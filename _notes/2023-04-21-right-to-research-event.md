It's been a while since we last posted a blog so a few quick updates
before the *Right to Research Event* news.

[[Patrick ffrench|Patrick]] has written an article on the background
to the production of issue 13 of *Recherches* with a specific focus on
the tensions between the broadly Marxist paradigm of leftist militancy
and the emergence of a [[Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ethos. The paper is
under review and we aim to post more about this soon.

We have also discussed a work-in-progress piece of writing on method on
'how to do a pragmatic genealogy of concepts'.

We are planning a research trip to Paris in May for archival research
and possibly interviews. The schedule of this will depend our family
lives and we are also attentive to France's pension protest and strike
plans.

Now for the *Right to Research.* The event is part of a research
stream I proposed inspired by the "*Right to Research"* manifesto,
written in 1975, by CERFI members. The manifesto was a reaction to the
French State\'s termination of \'research by contract\' in the social
sciences. Thereafter state funding for research could be granted only
to those with a formal academic affiliation, either as part of the
CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research) or a
University.

Although the right to research manifesto is not immediately related to
*Recherches* *13*, which is the main focus of our project, there is
continuity between the issues raised in the "militant interventions"
penned by [[Anne Querrien]], [[Françoise Paul-Lévy|Françoise Lévy]], [[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Straggiotti]] 
and in [[François Fourquet]] and [[Lion Murard|Lion Murard's]] preface,
and the manner these are raised, with the 1975's manifesto and with our
own research interests in *La Toupie Folle*.

The publications of these 'interventions' in *Recherches 13* intercalate
the theoretical and historical part of the research and allow looking at
the genealogy group as a living subject of research. Members of the
genealogy research group use these discussions to talk about the life of
the research, the militant desire, and to frontally raise the various
libidinal conditions of the research process. Through these, we
encounter the subject of research, not necessarily in the manner of the
researcher's gaze or situatedness, but in the manner of the material and
libidinal conditions of research production.

These 'interventions', if read together with the historical and
theoretical research, inform the pragmatics of the latter and the two
together form the work that interests us in *La Toupie Folle*. The
pragmatic genealogy of concepts would require an exercise of this kind,
an exercise of seeing theoretical production at the light of its
conditions of research.

This is also our inspiration behind the blog feature in *La Toupie
Folle* project, where we might refer to issues of money, work, ethics,
life that impact our research. Purposely, and as a research practice, we
have tried not to obliterate these from our reflections and our public
output.

The "Right to Research" manifesto argued that putting an end to the
financial autonomy of groups would end the possibility of
self-management and experimentation with a variety of forms of work,
research, and styles needed for social research. Moreover, the
professionalization of research would come with a focus on the
(professional) researcher as an individual to the detriment of
collective research experimentation.

More importantly, and something we haven't engaged with yet here, the
manifesto speaks primarily of the value to guarantee conditions of
existence for 'non-professionalised research' and for those who were
usually treated as objects of research to become subjects of research.

With the manifesto as a starting point, the ["Right to Research" event](/collective-forum)
will take place on 10th June in [May Day Rooms](https://maydayrooms.org/). It will be a meeting with research
collectives, associations, foundations, and varied groupings engaged in
research and experimentation, and individual researchers to share their
work, challenges, modes of organisation and management, funding
strategies and research ethos to re-think what the right to research
might mean today.

In the morning, each organisation will deliver a brief presentation
about themselves and in the afternoon, we will with a collective
discussion on topics such as the professionalization of research,
financial self-management, organizational processes and the articulation
between social production and theoretical production.

I thank [[Olivier Quérouil]], member of CERFI, who first drew my attention
to the manifesto and send it to me. I was immediately drawn to it,
particularly being an independent researcher myself!

[[Patrick ffrench|Patrick]] and [[Susana Caló|myself]] have translated the manifesto. This is a picture of
the beautiful cover.

We will post more about the event and participants soon and also share a
link to Eventbrite.

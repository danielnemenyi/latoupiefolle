Having met up with Co-I Susana Caló in London last week to talk about
the project -- first face to face meeting for at least a year! -- I
started ad hoc research and reconnoitring the territory around Issue 13
of *Recherches*, which bears the title *Généalogie du capital: 1. Les
équipments du pouvoir*. This issue appeared in December 1973. I have two
hard copy versions of this issue which I am reading against each other:
the first is the issue of the review itself, now nearly 50 years old!
(There is a strange temporality here which I would like to think about
more).

The other one is the 10/18 volume, published in 1976. Reading [[Dosse]]'s
*Gilles Deleuze Félix Guattari: Biographie croisée* it seems that at
some point in the 1970s (tbc) [[Florence Pétry]] -- the current director of
Editions Recherches (who is very willing to collaborate with us) -
arrived in CERFI and began advising [[Guattari]] on the value of a wider
dissemination of the volumes of *Recherches*, as well as of other books.
10/18, affiliated to the publisher Christian Bourgois was one of the
major and cheaper outlets through which 'French theory' was disseminated
in the 1970s, [[Dosse]] says in the rayons of Gibert Joseph in the Boulevard
St Michel (now sadly defunct, and recently).

One of the first things I discover is that the 10/18 volume amputates
the 1973 issue of some of its 'interventions militantes' and of some
of its paratextual detail, so that it appears as 'authored by'
[[François Fourquet]] and [[Lion Murard]], whereas the journal issue does
not indicate any specific authorship and mentions a wider group not
referenced in the 1973 version. Already affective and subjective
issues are raising their head, or heads, so to speak.

Looking around the edges of Issue 13 the story begins to emerge of a
rather tortuous editorial process which involved three key 'scriptors'
[[François Fourquet]], [[Lion Murard]] and [[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Stragiotti]] and a
wider group, about which more later. What is fascinating though is how
the journal issue in punctuated by what they call the 'interventions
militantes', in which various actors (I'll name them in a minute) write
about their libidinal and affective investments, in today's terms their
'feelings', about what is going on with the project. So they really did
put into effect the vision of a research project which involved the
manifestation and articulation of intersubjective and affective aspects
of a collective research enterprise.

It was also interesting to try to trace the chronology of the whole
project from the initial 'commission' from [[Michel Conan]] at the
Mission de la recherche urbaine (more on this later). It looks like an
initial focus, in the first few chapters, on 'La Ville ordinateur' and
'La Ville Métaphore' was perturbed and extended by the 'arrival' at
CERFI (in concrete terms in the apartment where they authors were
based for their collective authorship activities -- 103 Bvd
Beaumarchais and, nearby, Rue Popincourt, where [[François Fourquet]]
and [[Michel Rostain]] (key members of the CERFI 'mafia' as they were
called) had set up and lived -- of the Front homosexuel d'action
révolutionnaire (FHAR), or a delegation thereof. The 'official'
history, i.e the one recounted by Dosse which tends to highlight
individuals, says that [[Guy Hocquenguem]] arrived at CEFRI having
read *Anti-Oedipe* -- which apparently provided the theory for the
movement ('_c'est mon livre_')- and asked to take over an issue of
*Recherches* for FHAR. The issue did appear as Issue 12 (thus one
before our focus on 13), and it was this one - *Trois milliards de
pervers,* which gained Recherches and CERFI immediate notoriety and
[[Guattari]] a law suit. It may also have influenced the decision of
[[Estaing|Giscard d'Estaing]]'s government to withdraw funding from CERFI in 1975.
To find out more I watched [[Carole Rossopopoulos]]'s video film *FHAR* on
Mubi, thinking of Ros Murray my colleague and friend who is working on
this right now.

So it looks like there are several intersecting micro-histories here:

1\) the history of the policies of the State, specifically of the
Ministère de l'Équipment (under various names) vis a vis 'l'aménagement
du territoire' (I need to look into the lexis here, since 'équipment
collectif', 'aménagement du territoire' etc bear interesting comparison
and cross-reference with the conceptual terms in play, e.g. in [[Foucault]]
and [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] -- *dispositif*, *agencement*) and the specific
policy of CERFI to seek State funding for radical and experimental
projects (rather than going to the Cévennes to set up pre-industrial
communities as they say). I've asked a relative of mine who was a
British civil servant if she knows who to ask more about this, but she
doesn't.

2\) the composition and reception history of *Anti-Œdipe*, which,
together with 1), put CERFI and *Recherches* on the map for any
post-1968 radical project needing funding or just wanting money
(parallel with the 1970s/1980s GLC!?).

3\) the internal politics and micro-history of the *Recherches* people
....

Going too fast here to try to tabulate this... I'm still scoping out the
territory. I am thinking that the first things to do would be to map out
a Chronology and a survey of the Actors (with their biographies), then
a, overview of Issue 13, and go from there. \[See Chronology and Index
of Names\].

Reading the interviews in Morford, and Dosse, confirms that the 'mafia'
or 'noyau dur' of CERFI was Fourquet, Murard, Maury, Mozère, Rostain,
and Anne Querrien, although the latter was often more in the role of
intercessor between the two tendencies in the group -- Fourquet, Rostain
and Murard who sought independence from Guattari, and Mozère, Maury who
were more in his orbit. There are other ways of distributing the CERFI
actors, according to their provenance e.g. from the UEC, UNEF, of
'Opposition de gauche', La Borde (often combined), the FHAR contingent,
etc. Need to find a way to map all of this and present it visually.

Issue 13 features four types of writing: 1) the chapters on the
different aspects of the genealogy of collective equipment 2) the
'interventions militantes' 3) transcriptions of discussions usually
involving the three tutelary figures and the editorial group 4)
paratextual additions

Bibliography

Index of Names

Given the different types of writing one gets a different picture
depending on how one engages with the text. The chapters are footnoted
and include references, while the interventions refer to people by their
first names, except Deleuze and Foucault. One task then would be to try
to map the names mentioned in the interventions to CERFI membership.

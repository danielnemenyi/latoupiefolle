(trying to write this to self-reflect on the work) \-- incomplete

This is [[Susana Cal√≥|my]] first blog entry 5 months into the beginning of the project.
[[Patrick ffrench|Patrick]] has been working more diligently than I have. We have created
this way of working together whereby we can work together being apart.
We have a shared dropbox which means that whenever Patrick or I change
something in one of the files the other one receives a notification.
Sometimes that prompts me to see what the changes are and my mind drifts
back into the project each time this happens. We also meet periodically
either in person or on teams. When we meet in person we might speak
about other things that do not relate the project directly but that
inform our way of working. This has been a difficult term. This is the
third year of the covid now and we are all trying to adjust to new ways
of life. Recherches 13 and the philosophical, political and social
conjuncture that surrounds it does not cease to become a site of
fascination for me.

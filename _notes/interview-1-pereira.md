<strong>We engage in dialogue with researchers and authors whose work
intersects with ours. [[Godofredo Pereira]] is an architect, researcher
and head of the Environmental Architecture MA at the Royal College of
Art. He has led research on collective equipment and is co-author of
the forthcoming book *CERFI. Militant Analysis, Collective Equipment
and Institutional Programming*. In this conversation, we share our
work-in-progress research with Godofredo, find points of mutual
interest and hear some interesting feedback on our project.</strong>

---

**[[Patrick ffrench]]**: I thought it might be useful to summarise some of
the things we have done for our project. So we\'ve done a quite detailed
chronology of not only the work of the CERFI group itself, but also of
the things around it, such as publications, events, seminars,
lectures...

**[[Susana Caló]]**: Godofredo, this is similar to something I know you have
done in your research, a chronology that tries to capture the social,
political and conceptual context of the activities of the group.

**[[Patrick ffrench|Pff]]**: And we have been meeting online mostly to discuss these things,
and the trajectory of our thinking about it has changed a bit. I got
kind of into a more biographical approach, thinking about the kind of
conflicts and tensions that arose around the issue between the CERFI
group and [[Félix Guattari]], on the one hand, and [[Robert Linhart]] of the
*Gauche prolétarienne, on the other,* for example, and the responses to
the articles that were published in *Le Monde and Libération about
CERFI*. That led me into a kind of biographical research or fascination
with that context. We\'ve also done another thing, we\'ve produced a
number of what we call *dossiers*, which are not so much blogs, as
focused investigations on particular aspects. There's a [[Nietzsche]]
dossier, looking at how CERFI engaged with what was going on Nietzsche
at the time, one on [[Klossowski]], who was a kind of a tangentially related
connection to the CERFI issue, one on the FHAR (*Le Front d'action
homosexuelle révolutionnaire*) and one on [[Foucault]] as well. But more
recently, what we've been doing is to go back to our original aim,
which was to trace, to map, as we as we put it, the concepts that were
used in *Recherches 13*, to group them and then comment them. So, we're
just at the point of establishing a kind of list of key concepts and
groups of concepts, some of which derive or seem to derive from
L\'*Anti*-*Œdipe*, some of which relate more to Foucault and
*L\'Archéologie du savoir* and Foucault's earlier work *Naissance de la
clinique* and *Histoire de la folie*, some of which relate to [[Sartre]],
some of which are more baseline Marxist concepts like production,
dialectics and so on, and some of which relate to [[Braudel]]. We have a
draft list, we now want to try and analyze that or do something with it,
to map it and find some way of representing what we\'re doing with it. I
think that\'s where we are. Do you want to add anything to that, Susana?

**[[Susana Caló|SC]]**: I just wanted to add that the alternative title of the project
is *La Toupie Folle*, which means the mad spinning top, and is an
expression that we took from [[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Straggiotti]]

that appears in a collective discussion at the end of the issue to
describe the work in R13. The mad spinning top is a very productive
figure to understand the affective and intellectual interplay in the
issue so we are taking inspiration from this 'figure' to develop our own
research.

This project has been a very rich opportunity to experiment with a
couple of things, which means that we are also inventing things as we go
along and the project develops, as in a research-action approach to
theory. Patrick has been more the mad spinning top in terms of blogging,
much more than I, but these dynamics are generated from our lives or
desires at the time. But then we have kept a regular pace of meetings
where we reflect and think about what we should do next together. So, I
think that\'s very interesting. That\'s important to say part of the
project is that we also connect with other people such as you that are
developing very close work to ours like you have been for all these
years. The other two people we thought about entering into dialogue with
is [[Andy Goffey]] and [[Stuart Elden]].

So, I guess the other thing that\'s important to mention, Patrick, is
that apart from being doing research work about the CERFI, Godofredo
has, prior to that, or almost parallel to that, developed architecture
studios at the RCA about collective equipment. So what I think maybe
could be interesting, Godofredo, and thank you for your generosity
spending time with us, would be to hear what you think about the
project, know more about your work on collective equipment as well and
perhaps, Patrick, we have specific questions that we want to ask. I know
for example that Godofredo you have researched quite a lot of the work
CERFI did at the New Towns so it would be good to hear what you think
about the genealogy group in relation to the New Towns' group or its
research.

**[[Godofredo Pereira]]:** That's great, thanks for the overview. I think
the first thing in my mind is that it\'s actually quite interesting, the
complementarity between our projects. So, what we\'re trying to do, and
surely Susana has told you this already, is to focus on the arc that
starts in the 1950s and 1960s through to the 1980s. It\'s very much
based on interviews and all these archival materials, and it's an
attempt to rewrite the way in which CERFI's history has been told,
insofar as it has been told in a very fragmentary way by those few that
have approached it. But also, to rewrite the way that [[Deleuze]] and
[[Guattari]] have been understood, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon context,
very much from a Deleuze-centred perspective and a slightly apolitical
and acontextual reading of these authors. And so, what happens before
'68, with *FGERI* (*Fédération des groupes d\'études et de recherches
institutionnelles*) with *Opposition Gauche*, and during '68, and the
transition and the strategic decision to accept working with the state
-- which was not an easy decision -- is very interesting. And so all
these sets of decisions that are taking place mark a series of shifts
that imprint CERFI's life. But we don\'t have much time to dedicate to
everything, and we focus a lot on *Recherches 13* even though it is the
issue about which more is published, because it is where more work needs
to be done. I don\'t know if you have read, for example, [[Sven-Olov Wallenstein|Sven-Olov Wallenstein's]]
work that touches on *Recherches 13*. As an overall
research project on CERFI has not been done, you end up with fragmentary
readings of a fragmentary output, which produces incomplete
interpretations. From the moment that CERFI decided to put those very
nuanced and personal positions in the world that\'s unavoidable.
Sven-Olov Wallenstein is interesting. He has looked at CERFI, a few
decades ago, I think, maybe already a couple of decades, early 2000s.
His work is a good complement to that of [[Stuart Elden]]. It would also be
good to have Stuart Elden contributing vis-vis the influence of [[Braudel]]
in *Recherches 13*. It's important to understand that the way that CERFI
and *Recherches 13* read Braudel, and by that, I mean specifically how
[[François Fourquet]] and [[Lion Murard]] read Braudel, which is not the same
way in which [[Guattari]] and [[Deleuze]] are reading Braudel necessarily while
they\'re writing *Anti-Oedipe*. Even though that's not particularly
relevant for R13 itself, it trickles down into what are differing takes
on collective equipment from Fourquet and Guattari.

So, to go back to what I was saying, I would try to look at some of
[[Sven-Olov Wallenstein|Sven's]] work because he fits really well in the mix of characters that
you have here. [[Andy Goffey]] is great too. I started doing work on
collective equipment because he threw in interesting lines about
collective equipment in his introduction to the translation of
Guattari's 1979 work published as *Lignes de Fuite*. That's a work at
the end of the New Towns project. It\'s at the end of a process of
trying to bring an entryist-based approach into programming within the
state, and then Fourquet stays very much up until the end, writing about
the state. And very much within that unique thing, which is the French
state with all its multiple levels of institutional depth, in relation
to which Fourquet takes a much more anthropological approach. And so,
already there\'s a tension there to some of the things that will be more
manifest later.

As you were speaking a couple of things come to mind. You mentioned the
dossiers that you are doing, I think it would be interesting to look
into Lacan on the question of desire and need, because it was a crucial
reference for Guattari at the time, as well as Sartre, and then the way
in which the desire-need dyad in [[Lacan]] is reframed in a more kind of
positive approach, or productivist approach of desire, in Guattari. I
would say a few more things, I\'d note that the meeting with [[Michel Conan]]
is in 1970, it\'s a bit earlier. So, they meet him by chance, or
they meet the secretary by chance and they have the first meeting, then
they produce a text, then there\'s a call for tenders. And then there\'s
these two things: there\'s the funding for the exploratory work in Evry
and the New Towns. To my knowledge, all the research centres that
applied for funding by the urban mission received some funding. And
that\'s the first 1971 grant, the grant from 1971. So Evry starts a bit
earlier. I think it would be really useful to analyse this at the
moment. I have a spreadsheet where I check out important dates - for us,
there\'s an issue of scale, because the book focuses on CERFI itself.
But it is very important to see it not only at the scale, let\'s say, of
the theory that was produced at the time, but also in terms of key
political events and international political events, which are very
important for all these militant groups.

So, we know that Guattari comes from an earlier militantism, from the
late 1950s, around the breaks of the Communist Party, who would then
partner with younger groups that produce militantism on the back of
Algeria, in relation to Vietnam, but start looking inside and at
relationships that have to do with sexuality, gender, and etc. All of
them brought together by the critic of the incapacity of the Communist
Party to produce a properly revolutionary organization. So there\'s an
institutional aspect there that's core. And so what we\'re trying to do
in the book is to trace this encounter, between institutional
psychotherapy and critique and internal tensions to communism that
demand a new type of institutional form.

So, CERFI had two key decisions, I feel, one key decision is to say:
let\'s not go and do a hippie community in the middle of nowhere after
'68, which was a very common approach, particularly in the US but also
in France. If capitalism is inflected through state bureaucracy how do
we approach it? And it\'s an interesting question, because it forced
them to deal with the limitations of their own militancy that existed
within the different organisations; the Communist Party, the Trotskyist
International Communist Party; they all suffer from the same problems.
So, it\'s an inescapable challenge. And so when the possibility comes --
there's a pragmatics of funding - but it\'s also a very key challenge to
say: let\'s try and work it out at the level of collective equipment.
Yes, but what you\'ll notice and what we started noticing, is that in in
the group there are dissidences. And it's really complex to understand
the internal conflicts in *Recherches 13* just by the militant comments
that appear in there, because they lead to a bit of confusion. I would
note that [[Fourquet]] and [[Murard]], in their introduction, do a bit of
unpacking as well, even though it\'s a militant comment from the top, we
are writing this and we do the militant unpacking of nuances of erotic
knowledge and production, but still, from the top. But that -- and
we\'ve noticed it a lot in our interviews -- might lead to erroneous
conclusions. Insofar there was an interplay of both political
differences, personal inclinations, and very practical issues. So,
starting with personal inclinations, people like Fourquet and Murard
like writing a lot. And it was very much a site where they wanted to
invest their militantism. And you see that in Fourquet, if you read the
*Recherches* 14, and his critique of [[Althusser]], and where that
eventually leads. And these are characters that are very much not fully
convinced by the type of militantism that used to take place pre-'68.
And so there are certain types of characters that want to invest very
much in writing as a continuation of their militantism, and other people
that are less into that such as [[Anne Querrien]], [[Hervé Maury]], [[Liane Mozère]]
who are more interested in being on the ground and intervening, etc.
Now, that sometimes gets confused with other issues derived from
different positions on certain topics between men and women, but it\'s
not exactly the same, even though there are clear patriarchal aspects at
play. So, there\'s a political distinction there, but there\'s also
different types of readings. For example. [[Lefebvre]] was very important to
Anne Querrien, she did her PhD with him. And so with Lefebvre we have
the importance of everyday life and so she will do more inclined to do
work on the ground, versus someone like Fourquet or Murard. So yes, it's
important to understand the writing within certain events and a certain
context and pragmatics.

Some of these things can used to connect the dots in relation to the
discussion on axiomatics, the Trotskyist entryist approach etc. etc. But
some things are very circumstantial and quite new, in the sense of new
things that they are encountering, and so to disentangle this takes a
bit of care. But when we speak about internal conflicts, there\'s kind
of duration of internal conflict that works I would say
diagrammatically; it\'s correct to say that there is a more
theory/academic oriented group, and a more practice-based group within
CERFI, let\'s say in generic terms, these are different inclinations
within the group.

A few other things occurred as you were speaking, Susana was asking
about the genealogy group and the New Towns group. They are working in
parallel, but not working together. Fourquet and Murard were part of
Evry at the beginning but then Evry ends first and work in Melun-Sénart
and Marne-la-Vallée continues much further, leading into other types
of urban projects. These works are being developed in parallel, but not
theorised together in a systematic way.

**Pff:** So one thing that I don\'t think I\'ve quite grasped yet,
because I\'m sure there is material in *Recherches 13* or around it that
would help that but I haven\'t done that yet: I am still trying to
understand the composition of the various groups. So there\'s the
Genealogy group, the 'Crèches' group etc. I don\'t think I\'ve really
have a clear sense of what the differences were. And when they happened.

**GP:** I think that\'s an expectation that we will never get fully
resolved. I think there\'s dozens of groups. The most beautiful thing
about CERFI is that they redeployed funds to research less able to
receive funding. Let\'s say there\'s types of research that were able to
receive serious research money. And just as our institutions will always
take a 20% or 30% cut for building & estates or something like that they
will take a 20 or 50% cut, or whatever they decide to be honest, for
redistribution, and for further research projects. Now the most
systematic groups were the New Towns and the Genealogy groups, before
that you had the work in Bouake and Fnac. But then you have a bunch of
other things which they sometimes call Clubs, such as the *Psychotherapy
by Letter Club*. And it comes out of this idea of exceptional objects of
research. And this is something about which we go to quite a decent
level of detail in the book. It\'s about tracing these different types
of groups. Sometimes they're dormant; they sometimes exist, or they
don\'t exist.

And again, there\'s more than one research grant, one for the Crèches
group, which then publishes *Babillages*, but there are more; it is
difficult to find all the reports. And I think that\'s, again, one of
the important things that we hope to be able to say, in a clearer way,
which is that we should imagine this group and its ethics as towards
militancy and political impact; it's not towards due process for
research grant providers. So, they\'ll give one title and put [[Foucault]]
in the name, and someone else would do it and then someone else would
write it, someone who had the time. So it's a young group of researchers
which doesn't have a very systematic way of organization. Though I would
correct myself, it\'s not that it\'s not systematic: the way of
organizing themselves was very systematic in terms of what they felt
would be the core aspects, politically, of self-management -- to have
rotation in the management of money and funding, to allow for different
research grants, to allow you to drop out in the research process,
depending on your affective investments. So the question of how to write
this is quite interesting. Because the types of questions that we always
pose trying to find out this process for all of them: what was the
grant? when was the grant made? when was it approved? by whom? from
where they get the money? who was part of it? how was it then published?
what\'s the title of the report? what\'s the title of the output
publication if it goes public? it was originally an objective that I
had; I don\'t have it anymore, because it needs a different approach,
particularly when you interview them, and they literally contradict the
same thing that they\'ve said somewhere else. And I feel that it\'s more
important to speak of this inconsistency and these inconsistencies.
Okay, so now they\'re deciding to call it a different name. And that\'s
literally what they\'re doing. I think that\'s quite beautiful. So it\'s
not exactly that there\'s no system, but the system, the priority of
that organizational system is collective intelligence, leading into a
research which is not systematic, impact-oriented type of research,
right. And I think it\'s important to grasp that because what you find
sometimes in the literature on this is the classical historian sense and
aim to provide a sense of certainty.

**Pff:** That's really interesting. You mention this idea of rotation,
so that this idea that it\'s not systematic in the way that one might
have wanted it to be, but systematic in a different kind of way. I don't
think we have quite grasped that yet, Susana. But I'm thinking about our
idea of *la toupie folle* which we take from [[Vernet-Straggiotti|Marie-Thérèse]] and which she
uses to describe the kind of process when they have to draft a report
but is also something about the rotation of the work that relates to the
organization of the group. And it\'s also not collective in that
everyone agrees, and they kind of collectively, like a chorus, speak
with one voice. It\'s more like a spinning of different aspects.

**SC**: It\'s the mechanism itself. That kind of collective: it spins,
it might spin onto someone that does not want to do the work, who
doesn't know. So we should do that, [[Patrick ffrench|Patrick]], we should just spin it.

**GP**: I think that is an important concept. In the Clinique La Borde,
participation is not always on the same model and that kind of expected
model. And I think that was very important. Of course, that immediately
trickles down. They\'re also 20-year-olds, with revolutionary ambitions
and a bunch of other things going on. And so that can also be used to
post-rationalize a kind of laziness, annoyance, doing something else,
and so on. I think it\'s hard, let\'s say, it\'s impossible to
distinguish that, I don\'t find it that interesting, to be honest,
politically, I think it\'s obvious that those things would mix. But I
think it\'s more interesting, at least from our side, in the book, to
simply try to identify these kinds of shifting priorities, which means
that you\'ll encounter different types of challenges. And a lot of the
problems that CERFI had were self-inflicted. And a lot of the criticism
that CERFI suffers from results out of it. At the same time, a refusal
to falling into generic equality models, flat versions of democracy in
which we all do the work together, we all share something etc. They\'re
very much working through conflict, making it apparent, working it in a
way that allows a lot of it to remain. So that\'s also what then creates
the big fissures in the group.

**SC**: *Recherches* 13 certainly is interesting in that sense because
it has the collective discussions that contain, you know, harsh
critiques coming from some members, and these discussions intercalate
with the more historical pieces of research, and they could almost have
done two separate books. For example, [[Stéphane Nadaud]], when he writes
about the reviews, says that the work is not collective, you know, lacks
collectivity, I don't share this view. This is an editorial, collective
object in the sense in which they allow for those discrepancies to show
up, for all that conflict to be very visible.

**Pff**: But then they erased the original Interventions Militantes,
which raise these internal fissures, in the paperback edition and remove
that completely.

**SC**: We will have to ask [[Florence Pétry]] how that process was done.
What happened? Who made that decision?

**GP**: They erased [[Anne Querrien]], they erased [[Françoise Paul-Levy]];
there are a few militant interventions that they erased. And I feel
that\'s a very violent take. I think it\'s also interesting to
understand and to read the introduction. I think it\'s should be quite
near the beginning. I think it\'s actually a preface or just a little
paragraph. And we quote it the book, when we speak about these processes
of collective doing, how for example [[Fourquet]] introduces the work on R 13.
In one way, there\'s an approach which has to do with labour, who
did work. On the other hand, there\'s an approach to an expectation of
collective work. I think, even though CERFI wanted to do collective
work, what they didn\'t have is a unified idea of what constitutes
collective work? Is it a collective work, because we list all the names?
There are issues, for example in *Babillages*, where [[Liane Mozère]] lists
all the names of the people that participated in the research, and
listed her name as the author of the report. And that ultimately became
the format that were more happy with, because basically the difficulty
that they had was as follows: if we want to have all our names as
authors, we need to find a position of agreement in terms of the main
claims, which they would not find. Not to mention that there is a
difference between authoring a practical or research work, and authoring
the writing-up and publication of that work.

**Pff**: There\'s a part in the blog where I wanted to refer to the
authors, author, authors of whatever the point was, and I found myself
asking: what am I going to say here? Because I couldn't say CERFI, and
it\'s not exactly the Genealogy group. So I just used the shorthand of
calling it R13. So that\'s something we should think about, and perhaps
write about how we\'re referring to the collective or the group or the
author, the enunciator.

**GP**: Yes, and I think it\'s important to think through this internal
tension. Internal tension does not mean a problem that needs to be
resolved. That's my problem with [[Sven-Olov Wallenstein|Sven-Olov Wallenstein's]] essay on R13:
that there\'s almost an assumption that there\'s a group that should
work peacefully in a democratic way and come to a conclusion at work,
right. CERFI is anti-that. Actually La Borde is not a place to go for
healing; it's a place in which you mobilize your different effects
therapeutically. But you don\'t just try to resolve them. It\'s not the
place of conflict resolution. \[...\] Violence is literally the history
of CERFI. They say violence produced this issue, right? I think Susana
you quote that when you\'re writing that component, and I think it\'s
right. But it continues in the way that they think that\'s what they
brought as a critique of the Communist Party. That\'s what they brought
from La Borde as a way of deploying results, the kind of static
Communist Party or Trotskyist party structures as well. That\'s what
they bring in as a kind of device for political militancy, for work
through conflict. And then if it needs to break, it breaks, and it broke
at a certain point, there was no, there was not enough glue anymore. And
so I think it\'s sometimes simply too easy to say there\'s a conflict
here. Sure, that\'s not necessarily a problem. The Tuesday meetings were
supposed to be one of the key devices to constantly initiate those
conflicts and the other place was the Treasury, just the managing of
money, etc. Now, I think it\'s interesting to see that there\'s a
difference; what I would notice is that there\'s a difference in the
ability of certain people to approach that naturally. And other people,
for example, the members that came from the GIP, from the *Prison
Information Group*, and you feel in some of the comments that they're
not used to this. These are super important questions, but they need
context to avoid simplistic interpretations. And there\'s patriarchal
power relations here, and there\'s lack of organization there. And
there\'s a lot of things, but just identifying these specific moments,
without context, that\'s kind of missing out on the point.

Another question is what type of concepts make their way into the
military interventions? What concepts exist in a text that is not the
text that\'s supposed to be conceptual? It\'s a text that\'s around your
friends, but what concepts exist there? Which concepts make their way to
actual life? And do how you deploy them? Do you use
deterritorialization? Everyday, when you\'re having coffee,
conversations? So the interesting for us, is how concepts make their way
into the interviews, that's something Susana noticed from the beginning,
right? It\'s so beautiful, because a lot of these concepts make a
language through which to speak of your daily life. And so if you\'re
both working on the genealogy of concepts, I feel that would be one
interesting thing. I don\'t know how systematic it is, but at least
there\'s some lovely insights I imagine into how many of those concepts
make their way into the militant interventions, into the introduction by
[[Fourquet]], which words are actually used, which words get to be embedded,
right, and which ones are not. What is the stuff that you only deploy
when you\'re deploying some sort of academic finesse in framing an
argument?

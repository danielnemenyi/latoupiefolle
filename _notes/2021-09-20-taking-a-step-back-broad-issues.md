title: "Taking a Step Back; Broad Issues"
---

Taking a step back from R13, and attempting to identify the broad issues
that are at stake in it and around it (a move facilitated in part by the
indexing work on names, but also by fairly random reading, especially of
the 'interventions militantes'), I think it may be possible to propose
the following as overarching propositions:

R13 is a collective project, the work of a group. However this group is
not cohesive or coherent; the fractures, lines of dissent and conflict,
the differences, styles and modes of writing are not melted into a
seamless unity. There are indications within the volume of how the
process of its composition was somewhat chaotic; specific sections are
authored by different individuals or pairs of individuals within the
group; some bits of text ended up not being included. Moreover, the
group was not without its conflicts and hierarchies, with the
'Genealogy' group consisting of [[Fourquet]], [[Murard]] and [[Vernet-Stragiotti]]
[[Querrien]] and [[Lévy]] as somewhat peripheral or intermediary) having more
power and authority. The point is that the 'collective' work of the
group is characterised by a play or relation of forces, and these are
foregrounded and made explicit as part of the 'report' itself. In other
words, R13 is an example of a collective work in which the conflicts
implicit in that collective are exhibited.

Second point: these conflicts extend into what elsewhere we have called 
the 'libidinal and affective dimension'. But what this really means is
that the work is inseparable from the 'micropolitics' of money, time,
sex, childcare, love and hate, which affect the lives of all of the
adherents. This dimension is not like some kind of background or
autobiographical subtext; it is fundamentally part of the dynamics of
power and the politics of the time. In the terms of R13, this dimension
in that of desire, desire in its interaction with power. When we say
that R13 is a case study of the 'pragmatic genealogy of concepts', I
think what this means is that R13 exemplifies the idea of theory
(concepts) being libidinal objects, objects of libidinal and affective
investment, objects and vectors of desire. This in itself is a
manifestation and actualisation, so to speak, of the (Guattarian) notion
of transversality, *and* the post-May 1968 shattering of militant
leftism into multiple avenues of 'micropolitical' struggle (as opposed
to: the Althusserian primacy of theory; the dogmatism of the Party and
of Maoists).

Both of these factors relate closely to a third point, which is that R13
manifests a tension between *theory* and... not practice, but
'deployment', perhaps. The R13 authors are hyper-aware of their
relationship to the triumvirate of [[Foucault]]-[[Deleuze]]-[[Guattari]] (FDG), who
they call the 'grosses têtes', of the 'risk' of 'vulgarising' the ideas
of the latter. FDG's interventions appear as separate from the work of
the group as such. There are multiple references to the genealogy
group's consultation of texts and lectures by FDG, and some resentment,
for example, that FDG, Guattari in particular, is not more involved in
the Genealogy group. There are certain allegiances, with e.g. MTVS
seeming to be known as a Deleuzian, while others are more aligned with
Guattari, or Foucault. There is some discussion of the 'ownership' or
provenance of the ideas and concepts. Fourquet is perhaps on a slightly
different footing, with more authority, but even here, in the discussion
with Guattari, there is the sense that the former 'hasn't got it' (i.e.
the concept of anti-production and axiomatic of capitalism). In the FDG
interventions, especially around the question of 'categories logiques',
there is a kind of supervisor/student relation, wherein FDG seem to
suggest something like, 'this is not the right way of conceptualizing
collective equipment' etc. Again this is upfront, and R13 thus appears
to be something like an inverted architecture (like the Pompidou
Centre), with all of its workings on the outside. So even though FDG
promote the idea of theory as a toolbox, and the collective deployment
of concepts, when it comes to it it's not as easily done as said. The
relation between theory and 'practice' is thus itself determined by the
play of forces, as in the Nietzschean 'genealogical' method.

Other overarching or broad issues:

R13 is funded by the State; what it is *not* is either PCF orthodoxy
([[Althusser]]), nor Gauche proletairienne militancy.

It appears in a conjuncture, post May 1968, of a dominant and
authoritarian State (the 'police conception of history' described by
[[Kristin Ross]] in *May 1968 and its Afterlives*) alongside tendencies
toward renewal and reform ('new society', Vincennes, the funding of
CERFI projects by the Mission de la recherche urbaine, CORDES etc). This
is particularly schizophrenic (in a weak sense).

It is symptomatic of a decisive shift away from Marxist theory,
especially that articulated by Althusser, instigated in the main through
the reference to [[Nietzsche]] and genealogy (relations of force, the play
of desire). Foucault and Deleuze are key players in this regard.

There is a trajectory across the issue, from the discussion of the
'representations' of collective equipment (e.g. urbanism), to the
history of 'territories', to the analysis of the discourse of French
planification as such.

**Potential outputs**, then, might include an article on the 'moment of
genealogy' as evidenced in R13, and another on the 'social life of
concepts' (to adopt the AHRC project's title), which would specifically
focus on the 'interventions militantes' and how they construe the way in
which the concepts discussed are 'lived' by the women in particular,
with issues of personal formation, conjugality, desire, love and hate...

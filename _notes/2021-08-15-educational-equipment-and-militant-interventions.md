title: "Educational Equipment and Militant Interventions"
type: blog
---

After a hiatus, due to work on other projects -- translation of 
[[Pierre Fédida]], *Social Life of Concepts* reviewer responses, editing
of 'Proust-Machine' chapter with [[Tom Baldwin]], work on
Deleuze-Guattari-Proust for the *Italian Journal of Semiotics* issue,
[[Barthes]] and Fragments journal issue, [[Tel Quel]] and 
[[Marquis de Sade|Sade]] chapter, La
Personne en Médécine paper and Critical Medical Humanities dossier,
etc!... now returning to R13.

I realise that the notes on the 'Medical Equipment' chapter are
unfinished, as are the notes on Chapter 5, 'Le Discours du Plan'. My
plan is to look at the 'Educational Equipment' section, return to finish
off 'Medical Equipment', then 'Green Spaces' and 'The revolt of the
*mètèques'*.

To note that the preface tells us that 'Medical Equipment' was written
by [[Lion Murard|Lion (Murard)]], [[Vernet-Straggiotti|Marie-Thérèse (Vernet-Straggiotti)]] and
[[Lévy|Françoise (Lévy)]]; 'Education' by [[Anne Querrien|Anne (Querrien)]] 
and [[Alain Fabre|Alain (Fabre)]];
'Espaces verts' by [[Gilles Châtelet|Gilles (Châtelet)]].

**Educational Equipment**

To note first of all that a substantial focus by Anne on education,
especially primary schools.

See [[Stuart Elden]]'s [post on
this](https://progressivegeographies.com/resources/foucault-resources/foucaults-collaborative-projects/).
Anne is the author of the CERFI report: Généalogie des équipements
collectifs \[1\] L'école primaire -- [[Anne Querrien]],
Fontenay-sous-Bois: CERFI, 1975. Funded by grant number 73 01 503.

Elden says that: 'Querrien was a former doctoral student of
[[Henri Lefebvre]]'s sociology programme at Nanterre, and general
secretary of CERFI. This study also appeared as L'ensaignement 1.
L'école primaire, *Recherches* no 23, 1976; and its themes are
reprised as *L'école mutuelle: Une pédagogie trop efficace?* Paris:
Empêcheurs de Penser en Rond, 2005, with a preface by [[Isabelle Stengers]]'.

Pedagogy, education, and children is in effect a substantial thematic
right across *Recherches*. The first 5 non-thematised issues of
*Recherches*, from 1966 through to 1967 feature regular focus on it,
including contributions from [[Fernand Deligny]], [[Fernand Oury]], [[René Lourau]]
(on self-management; Lourau's contribution to R1 merits reading as it
gives an autobiographical history of the author's engagements with the
different currents; Lourau aligned with 'institutional analysis' and
co-authored with [[Georges Lapassade]]); material from a journal written by
pupils at a Dijon lycée (R2); [[Fernand Oury|F. Oury]] on [[Célestin Freinet|Freinet]] (obituary) (R3-4);
issues 6-7 on 'enfance aliénée'; issue 9 on institutional analysis and
pedagogy; issues 18, 20 and 24 convened by Deligny (*Cahiers de
l'immuable)*; issue 22 'Co-ire (Schérer and Hocquenguem); issue 23 which
is Querrien's 'Ensaignement'; R27 on crèches (Liane Mozère); 37 (*Fou
d'enfance*);

R1 mentions a 'Commission de Pédagogie Institutionelle' among the groups
affiliated to FGERI. R2 mentions a 'Groupe d'Education thérapeutique',
directed by [[Fernand Oury]] and a 'stage pédagogique' involving [[Deligny]], F.
Oury, [[Rostain|Michel Rostain(g)]], [[Prisca Bachelet]]..., a 'Club pédagogique';

N.B. that the thematics of psychiatry, 'alienation' and childhood
overlap in Deligny's work, since he is pioneering in the treatment of
'enfants arriérés'. Also in [[Lourau]], it seems, as the 'institution' is a
common focus.

N.B. that [[Anne Querrien]]'s father, [[Max Querrien]], was a 'haut
fonctionnaire d'Etat', directeur de l\'architecture au ministère des
Affaires
culturelles de [1963](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963) à [1968](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968);
then 'conseiller d'Etat' from 1970. He contributed to R6 on
architectural programming.

There is thus scope to open an 'education dossier', but this might go
beyond the limits of the focus on R13.

The 'Educative equipment' section opens with epigraphs from
[[Michelet]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] (!) which stress the
importance of education for politics.

From the rise of urban centres in the 12th century primary schools
become an instrument of the subjugation of the children of the people,
with the mastery of the Church. After the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes a special tax was instituted to support the creation of catholic
and protestant schools; this was the first time that the State got
involved in education -- in the 'production of educational equipment';
this is qualified as 'passer tous les enfants au même moule'; in 1724 a
'royal intendant' was responsible for their functioning. Schools thus
initially under the mastery of the Church, but soon became part of the
'rouages d'appareil d'Etat'. Note the [[Althusser|Althusserian]] terms here. The aim
was to bring children into the body of the State and citizenship. Fines
for parents who did not send their children to school. Notes the extreme
diversity and apparent chaos of the system. 'L'école est avant tout
l'espace dans lequel se déploient des châtiments corporels permanents,
l'espace de Sade, l'espace de l'instituteur (à venir).'

Enlightenment authorities ([[Diderot]], [[Robert Jacques Turgot|Turgot]], [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]]) insisting on the
necessity of uniformity. Turgot: universal instruction is the basis of
an 'Etat policé'. Children taken out of the family to be brought up in
common at the expense of the State.

Goes on to say that this is the basis of what will eventually become law
with the development of a real 'appareil d'Etat' across the whole
national territory; post-Revolutionary projects: normalising and
moralising 'quadrillage'; 'imposition d'un ration uniforme'.
Uniformization ad rationalisation (thus the term 'normale' to designate
the schools who will train the teachers). This is referred to as 'la
machine à former des citoyens français', but the different attempts to
do this 1789-1833 failed, and the church regained power. The July
Revolution (1830) was a popular revolt against the Church in favour of
the 'méthode mutuelle'.

Quadrillage idéologique imposed by 'reterritorialisation' of University,
which ensures homogeneity and 'surveillance.' [[Guizot]] -- Prime Minister
and architect of national education system. Creation of a system of
surveillance via the inspectors. Adult education. Sexual segregation.
Creation of 'maternelles' or 'salles d'asile'.

'Ainsi s'est constitué en deux années, d'un seul coup, l'appareil qui va
recoder aux niveaux national étatique (celui de la carrière de
l'inspecteur national), departmental et communal, les flux de futurs
travailleurs, détachés de la famille par le travail industriel.'

The 'Manifesto of the 60' in 1864

Summary -- 'équipment unique' -- lieu institutionnel producteur
d'assujettissements' -- injtection of the State and hierarchy --
'figures les plus redoutables de la territorialisation'

The principal emphases of the education section are on the
homogenisation of the educational apparatus and the role of the State in
this. Suggestions of the 'territorialisation' and 'subjection' of the
populace.

## Commentaries on some of the 'interventions militantes'**

**[[Anne Querrien|Anne]]'s 'intervention militante' pp. 159-61**: Anne
writes of the parallel 'series' of the 'genealogy of collective
equipment' project and her own 'social insertion', in which issues of
education and formation are a primary concern. At stake are her
'education' i.e. her academic work (at Nanterre? Sciences Po?) and her
decision to leave to 'collectivise' her 'intelligence', and capacity
to write etc. Seems to be conscious of the class divisions between
herself (daughter of a State functionary) and the disadvantaged. Can
'intelligence' be collectivized, and destroy intelligence as an
individual qualification? Anne says this was what was at stake in
UNEF, the Movement of the 22^nd^ March, FGERI and the Opposition de
gauche. All opposed to the PCF and the State it represented. She
contrasts the 'democratic' struggle against the State apparatus and
the 'partial struggles on a heterogeneity of objects of investment',
including education. She says that problems of education and formation
had been left out of focus. She refers to the law of July 1971 on
'formation' (the right of the waged to permanent formation or what
would now be called professional development); she says it has become
a 'good object', but communal organisations lack a profound reflection
on this and are thus often obliged to reject those who 'do not know
how to work'.

A refers to a 'Formation' group, which has few funds; it has a small
contract with an archaic University in Grenoble; but this group is not
very much 'coded' within CERFI; there is a 'desire to write'; ('chez les
femmes'); in this context, the Genealogy group appears as a close
'imaginary site', disconnected from the 'necessity' of permanent
formation. It was in the Genealogy group that the relation between
'executor and executed', and 'persecutor-persecuted' 'spoke' itself.
Anne says that everyone relied on [[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Stragiotti|Marie-Thérèse]] 
to assuage the blockage of [[François Fourquet|François]] and [[Lion Murard|Lion]]. But MT went on holiday
to Germany, pleading her wish to not be part of this and her love of
conjugality. She was delegated the part on logical categories,
'toujours deleuzienne imaginaire'.

But MT leaves, and Anne has to serve. The MLF has not fixed anything.
Anne says she has moved to Rue Baudricourt and there are now two 'women
theorists' (with Francoise). Anne is absorbed in the sexual, conjugal,
homosexual-masculine problematic accords much more importance to theory
insofar as she sees herself as inferior to the 'specialists' ([[Foucault]],
[[Deleuze]]), who are nevertheless not attuned to the political practice
(ref. to relations with the Gauche proletairienne and the Grandmontagne
meeting).

So -- a branch of FHAR was 'catapulted' into Cerfi by the 'éclatement'of
FHAR -- the strategy of [[Christian Hennion|Christian (Hennion)]]? Comes into the Genealogy
group for the preparation of the 'drague' issue. The group suddenly
becomes invested by transsexual research which falls to the group of
women; can sex itself be deterritorialised?

**[[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Stragiotti|Marie-Thérèse]]'s 'intervention
militante', pp. 175-79,** 'La révolte des mètèques' (the title
suggests those who were not formal citizens of the Greek city, i.e.
those working in the periphery of CERFI.) is an extremely interesting
reflection on the internal politics of CERFI and the conflicts that
arise within the collective, as well as on the nature of the relation
to 'theory'. She thinks about the ways in which the work they are
doing is really collective, and if so, is this not simply 'in the
service' of or in continuity with capitalism. While she concludes that
the usual answer would be that the collective work is not about
democratic majority or the 'law of numbers', but rather about
connected and fragmented practices which are 'transversally' joined
up, she thinks that this is susceptible to produce conflicts. Money is
a key aspect of this -- CERFI did not practice a 'value' system, where
money was given to people for a certain amount of work or time;
rather, it was distributed according to 'desire' (not according to
need). Nevertheless, 'clans' did surface in CERFI, especially as the
'Genealogy' group became more important; there was an apparent
division between the 'permanent' people and the 'peripheral' people or
the 'métèques'. She mentions a proposal from [[Guattari]] to transform the
distribution of funds to a minumum wage and a collective fund for
childcare, parking etc. But with the Genealogy group, [[Lion Murard|Lion (Murard)]]
and [[François Fourquet|François (Fourquet)]] and would hand out cheques. A certain
'despotism' emerged, which also was in evidence in decisions about
texts, about what to include and what not to. Earlier she had referred
to this as an 'ordinary fascism', with reference to the 1969 film
'Hunting Scenes in Bavaria'. The relationship to the Ministry is also
at stake; she makes it clear that it's not a 'hold-up', i.e. just
completing whatever needed to be done for the Ministry; there was an
investment in it, and the sense of a 'subversive' work. She doubts
however if this 'subversion; is not just a cover for not doing
anything, i.e., perhaps, for the abandonment of militant activity. On
the relation to 'theory' she asks if Anti-Oedipus functions as a
doctrine. She says she does find it annoying that sometimes the
language of Anti-Oedipus, - 'multiplicity of flux' etc, is used as a
dogmatic, empty, and normative injunction. She wonders whether they
are vulgarising and 'selling' [[Deleuze]] and [[Foucault]] (mentioning an
accusation from the latter). Has Anti-Oedipus become a norm? if there
are repressive norms and non-repressive norms, how does one tell the
difference? There are no rules, but only 'relations of force',
authority, opposition, and so on.

The point to draw out of all of this is that these conflicts and doubts
are brought to the fore and articulated. There is only desire, the
socius, and relations of force. The idea of consensus, of objective
work, of a model of value and agreement is out of the window. Yes, there
are conflicts, yes, theory is a doctrine, yes.

[[Marie-Thérèse Vernet-Stragiotti|Marie-Thérèse]] also writes the next 'intervention militante' (191-94),
where the relation to theory is also the primary topic. She is ware of a
kind of hierarchy, with the 'grosses têtes' [[Foucault]], [[Deleuze]], [[Guattari]]
constituting a kind of 'tribunal', something like a 'soutenance',
especially around Wednesday meetings which MT succeeded in abolishing.
She mentions Félix's intention to abolish the 'privileges' attached to
the theoretician and make theory into a series of tools for us, but the
theory/work division persisted; theory was not 'socialized'; hierarchy
was maintained, with the 'grosses têtes' simply apposing their
signature(s). She mentions the difficulty of working with the concept of
*genealogy* and the sense that this was not what they were doing;
Foucault's *'Hommage à [[Hyppolite]]'*, and a conversation with Deleuze
about finality and usage were important; [[Anne Querrien|Anne]] was 'branché sur'
Foucault's *Archeology*; conflicts around where the ideas of 'genealogy'
came from. So as well as a hierarchy, there is a sense of ownership of
concepts brought to light here.

**Third 'intervention militante' from Marie-Thérèse (257);**
Conjugality and territoriality in the group. A frenetic,
'schizophrenic' production of texts. The story of 
[[Lion Murard|Lion]]'s wife [[Catherine Murard|Catherine]] alone with the baby who threatens to
leave with some other guy but he is involved with the production of
the 'gros pavé'. The group 'closed on itself'. Here the instances of
desire and the 'distribution' so to speak of desire make themselves
felt, and are articulated as such. This is especially pertinent
insofar as the volume ends with the question of the family. How do
conjugality and collective work function in relation to one another?

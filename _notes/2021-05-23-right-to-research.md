title: '"The Right to Research" and a Further Spin'
type: blog
---

There is a long gap between this and the last blog, due to what is
often referred to as \'life events\', as if the work were separate
from the life; this is actually what the R13 \'experiment\' puts into
question, and the subject, often, of the \'interventions militantes\'
of the issue. In any case, coming out of the pandemic has been, in
another stereotype, more difficult than going into it. This says
something about the value, the hidden value, of enforced periods of
withdrawal, but also more pragmatically, about what has been opened up
and closed down by the facility of online communications. In any case,
[[Susana Caló|Susana]] and [[Patrick ffrench|I]] applied for and were
granted a 12 month \'no-cost extension\' to the project, which means
that the archival visits and interviews will take place in
autumn-winter 2022-23, as well as an interdisciplinary workshop. We
now have [[Daniel Nemenyi]] working with us, particularly on the
technical issues of the website, and he is bringing his considerable
expertise with systems to bear upon it, while also building the
website for us, with these blogs, and what I have been calling a map
of nodes, which indexes all the names in the blogs and connects them.

We have also decided on a new distribution of labour, whereby
I focus on the blogs, and Susana intervenes
punctually. In terms of the work to do, we need to develop our ideas
around what we initially called the \'mapping of concepts\', and find
a way of doing this; the idea is to track the way in which theoretical
concepts constitute a kind of toolbox for doing things with the
material, the material in this instance being the analysis of
collective equipment, the history of infrastructure, and, on the other
hand, ways of thinking about the nature of collective research, the
\'libidinal and affective elements\' of the process. The discussion
between [[Foucault]] and [[Deleuze]], \'Les Intellectuels et le pouvoir\' is
interesting in this respect, since it mentions the idea of theory as a
box of tools. [[Monique David-Ménard]] picks up on this interestingly in
her book *Eloge des hasards dans la vie sexuelle.  *  

So it was good that we decided to aim for two article-length pieces as
\'outcomes\' of the project. One would be more historically oriented and
relate precisely to the deployment of concepts, in 1971-1973, in this
conjuncture. The other would take as its starting point the \'Right to
Research\' piece published in *Le Monde* in 1975 as a reaction to the
State\'s termination of \'research by contract\'; thereafter State
funding for research could be granted only to those with a formal
academic affiliation (e.g. in a University or the CNRS). This key step
in the \'professionalisation of research\' can be seen, and was seen, as
a good thing, with benefits for the researcher in terms of a solution to
precarity. However professionalisation also has effects of
bureaucratisation and the normalisation of the process of research. We
think this debate speaks to contemporary issues. The current focus on
\'research culture\' or collaborative research, and impact, tends
towards the involvement of non-professionals (non-academics) in
research, not as objects but as partners, in a way which might be seen
to reverse the process of the State decision of 1975. How should we
understand what is at stake here, what are the risks on either side;
should the context be assessed in terms of risk? is not risk assessment
one of the key drivers and a dominant element in the ideology which
underpins the University sector as many others? The issues of money,
conjugality, equality will come into play, but, I imagine, quite
different ethical, socio-political and subjective factors will be at
stake. In other words the apparently pragmatic focus and subject matter
opens up substantial theoretical avenues to explore.

For the other article I was thinking of basing it around the topic of
\'Nietzsche in France 1973\'. This would not be an account of the place
of [[Nietzsche]] in French theoretical writing in the 1970s, but would take
the \'event\' of the reading of the *Genealogy of Morals* by the R13
group as the centre of a series of concentric circles radiating around
it, exploring how an encounter with a book like this, and with this
particular book, can generate effects, create connections, instigate a
\'spin\' of the *toupie folle*.

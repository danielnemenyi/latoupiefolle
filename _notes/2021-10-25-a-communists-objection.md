Back to *Pragmatic Genealogy* after a bit of a lull during which I've
been still obsessively excavating the '[[Klossowski]] dossier'. Other
factors in 'affective life' have also intervened. One more general
insight occurred to me -- I met with my friend [[Gavin Bowd]] last week, in
the Coach and Horses in Soho. Gavin is a Communist, or at least knows a
lot about the history of the PCF. I described the R13 project to him,
and he suggested that it had some resonance with the Nouveaux
philosophes! What a horrible thought! That R13 could be aligned with
what I think of as a kneejerk reaction to Marxism, and part of the
dismantling of the Marxist framework. But reading [[Fourquet]]'s R14 there
are certainly resonances. It reminds me that I should carry on with
that.

Yesterday, at work again, and finished the draft translation of the
'Presentation'. My plan is now to go through it and annotate, picking
out, as 'translation problems', or as translator's notes, the salient
problematics or conceptual nodes that might merit further discussion, or
suggest ways in to what is emerging as the nexus of theory and libido.
We could call it the **libidinal economy of theory**.

In the meantime, following up on a slight reference in the Presentation,
going to do some work on a 'Klossowski dossier'. Why? 2 reasons: the
term/concept 'supp√¥t', derived from his work (*[[Nietzsche]] et le cercle
vicieux*, and *La Monnaie vivante*) is important in R13 and especially
R14, for [[Fourquet]]. It is equivalent to the 'subject' but avoids the
Cartesian legacy and suggests something more like 'henchman'... So here
is a concept at work. Second, while only a minor mention to some extent,
the more one looks the more [[Klossowski]]'s influence appears crucial for a
whole range of thinkers, inc. [[Deleuze]], [[Foucault]], [[Lyotard]]... This seeps
in to R13 in the form of a '**theory of intensities**'.

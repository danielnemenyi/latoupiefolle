<h1> <em>La toupie folle</em> <span class="color-subtext"> / The mad spinning top</span></h1>

 December 1973 saw the publication of issue 13 of the journal
 *Recherches*, founded among others by activist and philosopher Félix
 Guattari in 1965. The issue was the outcome of a collective project
 undertaken by members of CERFI (Centre for Institutional Research,
 Education and Formation) on ‘collective equipment’, and bore the
 title The Genealogy of Capital: the Equipments of Power.
 
 These pages offer an account of a research project focused on
 *Recherches* 13, including a focus on the conceptual apparatuses it
 deployed, the multiple contexts surrounding the issue, and the
 research process involved. 
 
 For more information see our [about page]({% link _notes/about.md %}).

The project would not have been possible if the journal Recherches had
not existed as a tool for CERFI to publish and disseminate its
on-going research, without the support of Anne Querrien throughout the
years, the kind help from Florence Pétry at Editions Recherches, and
the work that preceded ours by colleagues such as Godofredo Enes
Pereira, Andy Goffey and Stuart Elden.

# Mad Spinning Top

 December 1973 saw the publication of issue 13 of the journal
 *Recherches*, founded among others by activist and philosopher Félix
 Guattari in 1965. The issue was the outcome of a collective project
 undertaken by members of CERFI (Centre for Institutional Research,
 Education and Formation) on ‘collective equipment’, and bore the
 title The Genealogy of Capital: the Equipments of Power.
 
 These pages offer an account of a research project focused on
 Recherches 13, including a focus on the conceptual apparatuses it
 deployed, the multiple contexts surrounding the issue, and the
 research process involved. For more information see our [about
